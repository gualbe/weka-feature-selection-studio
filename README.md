# Weka Feature Selection Studio
## A Feature Selection Studio plugin for Weka Explorer

New graphical user interface specifically designed to perform feature selection experiments in Weka Explorer allowing parallel computation. Predicted and actual values are produced in an exportable table, along with the desired attributes values. Moreover, an exportable table of evaluation metrics are also produced, in addition to a customizable bar plot.

Moreover, the CVOA optimization algorithm published [HERE](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/big.2020.0051) is also adapted in this plugin to search for attribute subsets, allowing its use along with any Weka attribute subset evaluation algorithm.
